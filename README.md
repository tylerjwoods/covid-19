# COVID-19

### This study is to answer the question: 

#### Do social distancing guidelines provide a change in the percent increase of the number of COVID-19 cases that a state reports?

I am not an epidemiologist. This study is being done for educational purposes only and should not be used in any scientific or policy-making way.

The number of reported COVID cases for each day/state was taken from the New York Times' GitHub (https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data). 

The date at which the state implemented stay-at-home orders was scraped from: https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-policy-watch/stay-at-home-orders-to-fight-covid19/
